/* ~~ The header is not given a width. It will extend the full width of your layout. It contains an image placeholder that should be replaced with your own linked logo. ~~ */
.header {
}

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

The villa has really enhanced our vacation. There is plenty of room for the family to dine and play together, and the babies can be rest without being bothered. My seven year old grandson starts each morning with a Foosball game. We visit the neighbourhood park nearly every day to use the basketball court, tennis court or playground. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the pool. It is the center of attraction for the children. Our two granddaughters (8 yrs. and 10 yrs.) just arrived yesterday as we rotated families. They swim competitively and are thrilled to have their own pool.&nbsp;Our first impression of the villa was the pleasant neighbourhood and &nbsp;neatly landscaped lawn. When we first came in, the open floor plan really impressed us. It only got better as we explored the home. We found all the rooms to be clean, comfortable and accommodating. The HVAC keeps the home comfortable. The home is quiet. You hear very little road noise (or neighbours). &nbsp;The extra amenities such as coolers, two sets of dishes, towels, washer and dryer,&nbsp;strollers, pack-and-plays, kitchen utensils, nightlights, etc. are wonderful. The location is great for the Disney parks. All the parks are less than 15 minutes from the villa.Dave and Louise have been great to work with. We had a smoke alarm beeping and within a few hours they had the battery changed. As I write this note, the pool staff are here cleaning the pool and the patio. I don't know what has been better Disney, the villa or the weather? I do know we are looking to our last week of vacation and future visits.<br>

The management company were good as there were a couple of issues that they came to resolve straight away. This was to replace a battery in the air conditioning unit and to fix the motor for the outdoor fan. I am sure that we will contact you in the future when we are looking to book further holidays to Florida. we really did enjoy staying in your villa we love that area, we rented a four bed roomed villa on rolling hills a couple of years ago the villa didn't compare at all to yours, so if we get the chance we will be contacting you again in the future, many thanks once again.<br>

We had never been to America before and it was wonderful to have the girls with us to see it together as it could well be our last holiday together as they are grown up now. We all enjoyed the pool area and some mornings the girls went off on their own and Wesley and  I enjoyed the solitude of the pool. We were also lucky with the weather as we only got rain twice when we were out, and I am tanner than I thought I would be. W e fitted so much in, we saw all the parks in Disney &amp; Universal, the Harry Potter areas and the train was unbelievable and there is nothing like a good frozen butter beer!! We also visited Miami and the Keys right out to Key West, Miami being my favourite. The Keys were disappointing but glad we went. We also travelled up to Clearwater. We also visited the Malls and outlets. I can’t believe we did so much. All went so smoothly with the<br>
travel and car hire. So Jacqui best holiday ever and thank you for the use of the best decorated best atmosphere and beautiful villa. We looked at so many online before we saw yours and we knew immediately it was the one for us, the decor is so me. I am such a fan of bright and happy. <br>
